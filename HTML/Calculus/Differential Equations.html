      In mathematics, a <b>differential equation</b> is an equation that relates
      one or more functions and their derivatives.In applications, the functions
      generally represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their
      rates of change, and the <b>differential equation</b> defines a
      relationship between the two.<br /><br />
      <b
        >A differential equation is any equation which contains derivatives,
        either ordinary derivatives or partial derivatives.
      </b>
      Such relations are common, therefore differential equations play a
      prominent role in many disciplines including engineering, physics,
      economics, and biology.

      <p class="paragraph">
        In classical mechanics, the motion of a body is described by its
        position and velocity as the time value varies. Newton's laws allow
        these variables to be expressed dynamically (given the position,
        velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body) as a
        differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function
        of time. <br /><br />
        In some cases, this differential equation (called an equation of motion)
        may be solved explicitly.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="subHeader">
      Order
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      The order of a differential equation is the largest derivative present in
      the differential equation. In the differential equation [\(m\frac{dv}{dt}
      = F(t,v)\)] is a first order differential equation. And,<br />
      \(sin(y)\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} = (1-y)\frac{dy}{dx} + y^{2}e^{-5y}\) is a
      second order differential equation.
      <br /><br />
      The order does not depend on whether or not youâ€™ve got ordinary or partial
      derivatives in the differential equation.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHeader">
      Types Of Differential Equations
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Differential equations can be divided into several types. Apart from
      describing the properties of the equation itself, these classes of
      differential equations can help inform the choice of approach to a
      solution.
    </p>
    <h3>Ordinary differential equations</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      An <b>ordinary differential equation</b> (ODE) is an equation containing
      an unknown function of one real or complex variable \(x\), its
      derivatives, and some given functions of \(x\). The unknown function is
      generally represented by a variable (often denoted \(y\)), which,
      therefore, depends on \(x\). Thus \(x\) is often called the independent
      variable of the equation. The term "ordinary" is used in contrast with the
      term partial differential equation, which may be with respect to more than
      one independent variable.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
      Linear differential equations are the differential equations that are
      linear in the unknown function and its derivatives. Their theory is well
      developed, and in many cases one may express their solutions in terms of
      integrals.
      <p class="paragraph">
        Most ODEs that are encountered in physics are linear. Therefore, most
        special functions may be defined as solutions of linear differential
        equations
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Partial differential equations</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      A <b>partial differential equation</b> (PDE) is a differential equation
      that contains unknown multivariable functions and their partial
      derivatives. (This is in contrast to ordinary differential equations,
      which deal with functions of a single variable and their derivatives.)
      PDEs are used to formulate problems involving functions of several
      variables, and are either solved in closed form, or used to create a
      relevant computer model.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
      PDEs can be used to describe a wide variety of phenomena in nature such as
      sound, heat, electrostatics, electrodynamics, fluid flow, elasticity, or
      quantum mechanics. These seemingly distinct physical phenomena can be
      formalized similarly in terms of PDEs.<br /><br />
      Just as ordinary differential equations often model one-dimensional
      dynamical systems, partial differential equations often model
      multidimensional systems. Stochastic partial differential equations
      generalize partial differential equations for modeling randomness.
    </div>
    <h3>Non-linear differential equations</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      A <b>non-linear differential equation</b> is a differential equation that
      is not a linear equation in the unknown function and its derivatives (the
      linearity or non-linearity in the arguments of the function are not
      considered ).<br />
      There are very few methods of solving nonlinear differential equations
      exactly; those that are known typically depend on the equation having
      particular symmetries. Nonlinear differential equations can exhibit very
      complicated behavior over extended time intervals, characteristic of
      chaos.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
      Linear differential equations frequently appear as approximations to
      nonlinear equations. These approximations are only valid under restricted
      conditions. For example, the harmonic oscillator equation is an
      approximation to the nonlinear pendulum equation that is valid for small
      amplitude oscillations
    </div>
    <div class="summary">
      <p class="paragraph">
        Solving differential equations is not like solving algebraic equations.
        Not only are their solutions often unclear, but whether solutions are
        unique or exist at all are also notable subjects of interest. For first
        order initial value problems, the Peano existence theorem gives one set
        of circumstances in which a solution exists.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Given any point \((a,b)\) in the xy-plane, define some rectangular
        region \(Z\), such that \(Z=[l,m]\times [n,p]\) and \((a,b)\) is in the
        interior of \(Z\).If we are given a differential equation
        \({\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=g(x,y)}\) and the condition that
        \(y=b\) and \(x=a\), then there is locally a solution to this problem if
        \(g(x,y)\) and \(\frac {\partial g}{\partial x}\) are both continuous on
        \(Z\)
