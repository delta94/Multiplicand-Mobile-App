      In ​probability theory​ and related fields, a <b>​stochastic​</b> or ​<b
        >random process​</b
      >
      is a ​mathematical object usually defined as a ​family​ of ​random
      variables​. Historically, the random variables were associated with or
      indexed by a set of numbers, usually viewed as points in time, giving the
      interpretation of a stochastic process representing numerical values of
      some system ​randomly​ changing over ​time​, such as the growth of a
      ​bacterial​ population, an ​electrical current​ fluctuating due to
      ​thermal noise​, or the movement of a ​gas​ ​molecule​.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Stochastic processes are widely used as ​mathematical models​ of systems
      and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. They have
      applications in many disciplines including ​sciences​ such as ​biology​,​
      ​chemistry​,​ ​ecology​,​ ​neuroscience​,​ and ​physics​ as well as
      ​technology​ and ​engineering​ fields such as ​image processing​, ​signal
      processing , Information Theory ​computer science​,​ ​cryptography​ and
      telecommunications​.​ Furthermore, seemingly random changes in ​financial
      markets​ have motivated the extensive use of stochastic processes in
      ​finance​.​
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
      <p class="paragraph">
        Applications and the study of phenomena have in turn inspired the
        proposal of new stochastic processes. Examples of such stochastic
        processes include the ​Wiener process​ or Brownian motion processused by
        <b>Louis Bachelier</b> and the ​Poisson process​, used by ​A. K. Erlang​
        to study the number of phone calls occurring in a certain period of
        time.​ These two stochastic processes are considered the most important
        and central in the theory ​ of stochastic processes,​ and were
        discovered repeatedly and independently, both before and after Bachelier
        and Erlang, in different settings and countries.​
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
      But often these two terms are used when the random variables are indexed
      by the ​integers​ or an ​interval​ of the ​real line​.​ If the random
      variables are indexed by the ​Cartesian plane​ or some higher-dimensional
      ​Euclidean​ space​, then the collection of random variables is usually
      called a ​random field​ instead.​ The values of a stochastic process are
      not always numbers and can be vectors or other mathematical objects.​
    </p>
    <div class="summary">
      <p class="paragraph">
        Based on their mathematical properties, stochastic processes can be
        grouped into various ​ categories, which include ​<b>random walks</b>​,​
        <b>​martingales​</b>,​ ​<b>Markov processes</b>​,​ <b>​Lévy process</b>,
        <b>​​Gaussian processes</b>​,​ <b>random fields</b>,​ ​<b
          >renewal processes</b
        >​, and ​<b>branching processes</b>. The study of stochastic processes
        uses mathematical knowledge and techniques from ​ probability​,
        ​calculus​, ​linear algebra​, ​set theory​, and ​topology​ as well as
        branches of mathematical analysis​ such as ​real analysis​, ​measure
        theory​, ​Fourier analysis​, and ​functional​ analysis​.​ The theory of
        <b>stochastic process</b> is considered to be an important contribution
        to mathematics​ and it continues to be an active topic of research for
        both theoretical reasons and applications
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
      A <b>stochastic</b> or <b>random process</b> can be defined as a
      collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set,
      meaning that each random variable of the <b>stochastic process</b> is
      uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used to index the
      random variables is called the index set​. Historically, the index set was
      some ​subset​ of the ​real line​, such as the ​natural numbers​,​ giving
      the index set the interpretation of time.​ Each random variable in the
      collection takes values from the same ​mathematical space​ known as the
      ​state space​. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the
      real line or \({\displaystyle n}\)-dimensional Euclidean space.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      An ​increment​ is the amount that a <b>stochastic process</b> changes
      between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time.​ A
      stochastic process can have many ​outcomes​, due to its randomness, and a
      single outcome of a <b>stochastic process</b> is called, among other
      names, a ​sample function​ or ​realization​.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
      <p class="paragraph">
        A <b>stochastic process</b> is defined as a collection of random
        variables defined on a common ​probability space \({\displaystyle
        (\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},P)}\) , where \({\displaystyle \Omega }\) is a
        ​sample space​, \({\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}\) is a \({\displaystyle
        \sigma }\)-​algebra​, and \({\displaystyle P}\) is a ​probability
        measure​; and the random variables, indexed by some set \({\displaystyle
        T}\), all take values in the same mathematical space \({\displaystyle
        S}\), which must be ​measurable​ with respect to some \({\displaystyle
        \sigma }\) -algebra \({\displaystyle \Sigma }\)
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        In other words, for a given probability space or a given probability
        space \({\displaystyle (\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},P)}\) \((\Omega
        ,{\mathcal {F}},P)\) and a measurable space \({\displaystyle (S,\Sigma
        )}(S,\Sigma )\), a <b>stochastic process</b> is a collection of
        \({\displaystyle S}\) -valued random variables, which can be written
        as:<br />
        \({\displaystyle \{X(t):t\in T\}.}\) Historically, in many problems from
        the natural sciences a point \({\displaystyle t\in T}\) in T had the
        meaning of time, so \({\displaystyle X(t)}\) is a random variable
        representing a value observed at time \({\displaystyle t}\) . A
        <b>stochastic process</b> can also be written as \({\displaystyle
        \{X(t,\omega ):t\in T\}}\) to reflect that it is actually a function of
        two variables, \({\displaystyle t\in T}\) and \({\displaystyle \omega
        \in \Omega }\). There are other ways to consider a stochastic process,
        with the above definition being considered the traditional one.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
      The law of a stochastic process or a random variable is also called the
      <b>​probability law</b> ​, <b>​probability distribution</b>​, or the
      <b>​distribution​</b>.​
