      To define <b>probability distributions</b> for the simplest cases, it is
      necessary to distinguish between discrete​ and ​continuous​ ​random
      variables​. In the discrete case, it is sufficient to specify a
      probability mass function \({\displaystyle p}\) assigning a probability to
      each possible outcome: for example, when throwing a fair ​die​, each of
      the six values 1 to 6 has the probability 1/6. The probability of an
      ​event​ is then defined to be the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes
      that satisfy the event; for example, the probability of the event "the
      dice rolls an even value" is \({\displaystyle
      p(2)+p(4)+p(6)=1/6+1/6+1/6=1/2.}\)
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
      In contrast, when a random variable takes values from a continuum then
      typically, any individual outcome has probability zero and only events
      that include infinitely many outcomes, such as intervals, can have
      positive probability. For example, the probability that a given object
      weighs exactly​ 500 g is zero, because the probability of measuring
      exactly 500 g tends to zero as the accuracy of our measuring instruments
      increases. Nevertheless, in quality control one might demand that the
      probability of a "500 g" package containing between 490 g and 510 g should
      be no less than 98%, and this demand is less sensitive to the accuracy of
      measurement instruments
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <b>Continuous probability distributions</b> can be described in several
      ways. The ​probability density function​ describes the ​infinitesimal​
      probability of any given value, and the probability that the outcome lies
      in a given interval can be computed by ​integrating​ the probability
      density function over that interval. The probability that the possible
      values lie in some fixed interval can be related to the way sums converge
      to an integral; therefore, continuous probability is based on the
      definition of an integral.

      <p class="paragraph">
        The ​<b>cumulative distribution function​</b> describes the probability
        that the random variable is no larger than a given value; the
        probability that the outcome lies in a given interval can be computed by
        taking the difference between the values of the cumulative distribution
        function at the endpoints of the interval. The cumulative distribution
        function is the ​antiderivative​ of the probability density function
        provided that the latter function exists. The cumulative distribution
        function is the area under the ​probability density function​ from minus
        infinity \({\displaystyle \infty }\) to \({\displaystyle x}\)

      probabilities of intervals of values correspond to the area under the
      curve.

    <h2 class="subHeader">Discrete probability distribution</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      A ​discrete probability distribution​ is a probability distribution that
      can take on a countable number of values.​ For the probabilities to add up
      to 1, they have to decline to zero fast enough. For example, if
      \({\displaystyle \operatorname {P} (X=n)={\tfrac {1}{2^{n}}}}\) or ​n​ =
      1, 2, ..., the sum of probabilities would be 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... = 1.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
      <p class="paragraph">
        Well-known discrete probability distributions used in statistical
        modeling include the ​Poisson distribution​, the ​Bernoulli
        distribution​, the ​binomial distribution​, the ​geometric
        distribution​, and the negative binomial distribution​.​ Additionally,
        the ​discrete uniform distribution​ is commonly used in computer
        programs that make equal-probability random selections between a number
        of choices. When a ​sample​ (a set of observations) is drawn from a
        larger population, the sample points have an empirical distribution​
        that is discrete and that provides information about the population
        distribution.

      Continuous probability distribution
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      A <b>​continuous probability distribution</b> ​ is a probability
      distribution with a cumulative distribution function that is ​absolutely
      continuous​. Equivalently, it is a probability distribution on the ​real
      numbers that is ​absolutely continuous​ with respect to ​Lebesgue
      measure​. Such distributions can be represented by their ​probability
      density functions​. <br />
      If the distribution of ​X​ is continuous, then ​X​ is called a ​continuous
      random variable​. There are many examples of continuous probability
      distributions: ​normal​, ​uniform​, ​chi-squared​, and ​others​.
    </p>
    <div class="summary">
      <p class="paragraph">
        Formally, if ​X​ is a continuous random variable, then it has a
        ​probability density function​ ​ƒ(​ ​x)​ , and therefore its probability
        of falling into a given interval, say [​a,​ ​b​], is given by the
        integral \({\displaystyle \operatorname {P} [a\leq X\leq b]=\int
        _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx} \) <br />
        In particular, the probability for ​X​ to take any single value ​a​
        (that is ​a​ ≤ ​X​ ≤ ​a)​ is zero, because an integral​ with coinciding
        upper and lower limits is always equal to zero.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        These distributions are the ones \({\displaystyle \mu }\) such that
        \({\displaystyle \mu \{x\}\,=\,0}\) for all \({\displaystyle \,x}\).
        This definition includes the (absolutely) continuous distributions
        defined above, but it also includes ​singular distributions​, which are
        neither absolutely continuous nor discrete nor a mixture of those, and
        do not have a density.
