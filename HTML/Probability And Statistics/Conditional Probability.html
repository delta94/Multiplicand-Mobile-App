    <p class="paragraph">
      In ​probability theory​, <b>​conditional probability​</b> is a measure of
      the ​probability​ of an ​event​ occurring ​ given that another event has
      (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence) occurred
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      If the event of interest is ​A​ and the event ​B​ is known or assumed to
      have occurred, "the conditional probability of ​A​ given ​B​", or "the
      probability of ​A​ under the condition ​B​", is usually written as P(​A​ |
      ​B​),or sometimes <b>\(P_{B}A\) or P(​A​ / ​B​)</b> . For example, the
      probability that any given person has a cough on <b>B</b>​ any given day
      may be only 5%. But if we know or assume that the person is sick, then
      they are much more likely to be coughing. The conditional probability that
      someone unwell is coughing might be 75%, then: P(Cough) = 5%; P(Cough |
      Sick) = 75%.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
      <p class="paragraph">
        The concept of conditional probability is one of the most fundamental
        and one of the most important in probability theory.But conditional
        probabilities can be quite slippery and require careful interpretation.
        For example, there need not be a causal relationship between ​A​ and
        ​B​, and they don't have to occur simultaneously.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
      P(​A​ | ​B)​ may or may not be equal to P(​A​) (the unconditional
      probability of ​A​). If P(​A​ | ​B​) = P(​A​), then events ​A​ and ​B​ are
      said to be ​"independent"​: in such a case, knowledge about either event
      does not give ​information​ on the other. P(​A​ | ​B​) (the conditional
      probability of A given B) typically differs from P(​B​ | ​A)​ . For
      example, if a person has ​dengue​, they might have a 90% chance of testing
      positive for dengue. In this case what is being measured is that if event
      ​B​ ("having dengue") has occurred, the probability of ​A​ (​test is
      positive​) given that ​B​ (​having dengue)​ occurred is 90%: that is,
      P(​A​ | ​B​) = 90%.<br /><br />
      Alternatively, if a person tests positive for dengue they may have only a
      15% chance of actually having this rare disease because the ​false
      positive​ rate for the test may be high. In this case what is being
      measured is the probability of the event ​B​ (​having dengue​) given that
      the event ​A​ (​test is positive​) has occurred: P(​B​ | ​A​) = 15%.
      Falsely equating the two probabilities causes various errors of reasoning
      such as the ​base rate fallacy​. Conditional probabilities can be reversed
      using <b>Bayes' theorem​</b>.

        Conditioning on an event
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
        <b>Kolmogorov definition:</b> <br>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Given two ​events​ ​A​ and ​B​, from the ​sigma-field​ of a probability space, with the ​unconditional probability​ of B
            (that is, of the event ​B​ occurring) being greater than zero, ​P(​ ​B)​ > 0, the conditional probability of ​A​ given
            ​B​ is defined as the ​quotient​ of the probability of the joint of events ​A​ and ​B​, and
            the ​probability​ of ​B:​ <br>
            \({\displaystyle P(A\mid B)={\frac {P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}},}\) where <br>
            \({\displaystyle P(A\cap B)}\) is the probability that both events ​A​ and ​B​ occur. This may be visualized as restricting the sample space to
            situations in which ​B​ occurs. The logic behind this equation is that if the possible outcomes for ​A​ and ​B​ are
            restricted to those in which ​B​ occurs, this set serves as the new sample space. <br>
            We just denote the quantity \({\displaystyle {\frac {P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}}}\) as 
            \({\displaystyle P(A\mid B)}\) and call it the conditional probability of ​A​ given ​B​.
            <br><br>
            \({\displaystyle P(A\cap B)=P(A\mid B)P(B)}\)
            <br>
            Although mathematically equivalent, this may be preferred philosophically; under major ​probability interpretations​
            such as the <b>​subjective theory</b>​, conditional probability is considered a primitive entity. Further, this "multiplication
            axiom" introduces a symmetry with the summation axiom for ​mutually
            exclusive events​:​ <br>
            \({\displaystyle P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-{{P(A\cap B)}}}\)
            <br><br>
            Conditional probability can be defined as the probability of a conditional event
            \({\displaystyle A_{B}}\). It can be shown that
           \({\displaystyle P(A_{B})={\frac {P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}}}\) which meets the Kolmogorov definition of conditional probability. Note that the equation
           \({\displaystyle P(A_{B})=P(A\cap B)/P(B)}\) is a theoretical result and not a definition. The definition via conditional events can be understood directly in terms
          of the ​Kolmogorov axioms​ and is particularly
          close to the Kolmogorov ​interpretation of probability​ in terms of experimental data. For example, conditional events
          can be repeated themselves leading to a generalized notion of conditional event \({\displaystyle A_{B(n)}}\) It can be shown​ that the sequence 
          \({\displaystyle (A_{B(n)})_{n\geq 1}}\) which yields a ​strong law of large numbers​ for conditional probability: \({\displaystyle P\left(\lim _{n\to \infty }{\overline {A}}_{B}^{n}=P(A\mid
          B)\right)=100\%}\)
