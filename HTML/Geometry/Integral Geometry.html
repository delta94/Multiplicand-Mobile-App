    <p class="paragraph">
      In mathematics, <b>Integral geometry</b> is the theory of measures on a
      geometrical space invariant under the symmetry group of that space. In
      more recent times, the meaning has been broadened to include a view of
      invariant (or equivariant) transformations from the space of functions on
      one geometrical space to the space of functions on another geometrical
      space. Such transformations often take the form of integral transforms
      such as the Radon transform and its generalizations.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
      <p class="paragraph">
        The theory of invariant measures (with respect to continuous groups of
        transformations of a space onto itself) on sets consisting of
        submanifolds of the space (for example, lines, planes, geodesics, convex
        surfaces, etc.; in other words, manifolds preserving their type under
        the transformations in question). Integral geometry has been constructed
        for various spaces, primarily Euclidean, projective and homogeneous
        spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >Integral geometry is concerned with the introduction of invariant
          measures, their relationships and their geometric applications. It
          arose in connection with refinements of statements of problems in
          geometric probabilities.</b

      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
      In order to introduce an invariant measure one tries to begin with a
      function depending on the coordinates of the space under consideration
      whose integral over some region of the space is not changed under any
      continuous coordinate transformation belonging to a specified Lie group.
      This requires finding an integral invariant of the Lie group. The latter
      can be found as a solution to the system of partial differential equations
      <br /><br />
      \(\sum_{1}^{n}\frac{\partial }{\partial x_i}[\varepsilon _{h}^{i}F(x)]\)
      \(= 0\), \(h = -1, ... r\)
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Where \(F(x)\) is the required integral invariant \(x\) is a point of the
      space (having dimension \(n)\), \(\varepsilon _{h}^{i}\) are the
      coefficients of the infinitesimal transformation of the group, and \(r\)
      is the number of parameters of the transformation. Of great significance
      in integral geometry are measurable Lie groups, that is, groups that admit
      one and only one invariant (up to a constant factor). In particular,
      simple transitive groups are of this type.
    </p>
    <div class="summary">
      <p class="paragraph">
        In integral geometry on the Euclidean plane \(E^2\) one usually
        considers only one type of continuous transformation, namely, the group
        of motions (without reflections). For a set of points, the integral
        invariant is the unit, for a set of lines it is again the unit if one
        selects for the parameters of the lines the parameters \(p\) and \(\phi
        \) 0f its normal equation.The measure of a set of straight lines
        intersecting two convex figures (ovals) is equal to the difference of
        the lengths of the crossed common tangent lines of the oval and the
        outer common tangent lines. Outer common tangent lines Crossed common
        tangent lines

      </figure>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The measure of the set of straight lines dividing two ovals is equal to
        the length of the crossed common tangent lines minus the sum of the
        lengths of the contours of the ovals
