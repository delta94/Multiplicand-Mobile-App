        "Geometry is a branch of mathematics concerned with questions of shape, size, relative
        position of figures, and the properties of space.A mathematician who works in the field of
        geometry is called a geometer."

        Axioms
    </h2>
    <div class="theorem">
        <p>
            An axiom or postulate is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or
            starting point for further reasoning and arguments. In the field of mathematical logic, a
            clear distinction is made between two notions of axioms: logical and non-logical.
        </p>
        <p>
            Euclid took an abstract approach to geometry in his Elements, one of the most influential
            books ever written.Euclid introduced certain axioms, or postulates, expressing primary or
            self-evident properties of points, lines, and planes.He proceeded to rigorously deduce other
            properties by mathematical reasoning. The characteristic feature of Euclid's approach to
            geometry was its rigor, and it has come to be known as axiomatic or synthetic geometry. At
            the start of the 19th century, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries by Nikolai
            Ivanovich Lobachevsky (1792–1856), János Bolyai (1802–1860), Carl Friedrich Gauss
            (1777–1855) and others led to a revival of interest in this discipline, and in the 20th
            century, David Hilbert (1862–1943) employed axiomatic reasoning in an attempt to provide a
            modern foundation of geometry.

    <h2 class="subHeader">Points</h2>
    <div class="theorem">
        <p>
            Points are considered fundamental objects in Euclidean geometry. They have been defined in a
            variety of ways, including Euclid's definition as 'that which has no part' and through the
            use of algebra or nested sets. In many areas of geometry, such as analytic geometry,
            differential geometry, and topology, all objects are considered to be built up from points.
            However, there has been some study of geometry without reference to points

            There are several inequivalent definitions of dimension in mathematics. In all of the common
            definitions, a point is 0-dimensional.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Vector space dimension</b><br />
                <p>
                    The dimension of a vector space is the maximum size of a linearly independent subset. In
                    a vector space consisting of a single point (which must be the zero vector 0), there is
                    no linearly independent subset. The zero vector is not itself linearly independent,
                    because there is a non trivial linear combination making it zero: \({\displaystyle
                    1\cdot \mathbf {0} =\mathbf {0} }\)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Topological dimension</b><br />
                <p>
                    The topological dimension of a topological space X is defined to be the minimum value of
                    n, such that every finite open cover \( {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}}{\mathcal {A}}\)
                    of \(X\) admits a finite open cover \({\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}{\mathcal {B}}\) of
                    X which refines \({\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}}{\mathcal {A}}\) in which no point is
                    included in more than \(n+1\) elements. If no such minimal n exists, the space is said
                    to be of infinite covering dimension. A point is zero-dimensional with respect to the
                    covering dimension because every open cover of the space has a refinement consisting of
                    a single open set.

            <li>
                <b>Hausdorff dimension</b><br />
                <p>
                    Let X be a metric space. If \(S ⊂ X\) and \(d ∈ [0, ∞)\), the d-dimensional Hausdorff
                    content of \(S \) is the infimum of the set of numbers \(δ ≥ 0\) such that there is some
                    (indexed) collection of balls \({\displaystyle \{B(x_{i},r_{i}):i\in I\}}\)\(
                    \{B(x_i,r_i):i\in I\}\) covering \(S \) with \(ri > 0\) for each \(i ∈ I\) that
                    satisfies <br />
                    \({\displaystyle \sum _{i\in I}r_{i}^{d}
                    <\delta }\sum_{i\in I} r_i^d<\delta \).<br />
                    The Hausdorff dimension of \(X\) is defined by
                    \(\operatorname{dim}_{\operatorname{H}}(X):= \) \(\inf\{d\ge 0: C_H^d(X)=0\}.\). A point
                    has Hausdorff dimension 0 because it can be covered by a single ball of arbitrarily
                    small radius.

    <h2 class="subHeader">Lines</h2>
    <div class="theorem">
        <p>
            Euclid described a line as "breadthless length" which "lies equally with respect to the
            points on itself".In modern mathematics, given the multitude of geometries, the concept of a
            line is closely tied to the way the geometry is described.<br />
            For instance, in analytic geometry, a line in the plane is often defined as the set of
            points whose coordinates satisfy a given linear equation, but in a more abstract setting,
            such as incidence geometry, a line may be an independent object, distinct from the set of
            points which lie on it.In differential geometry, a geodesic is a generalization of the
            notion of a line to curved spaces

                The red and blue lines on this graph have the same slope (gradient); the red and green
                lines have the same y-intercept (cross the y-axis at the same place).

        </figure>
        <p>
            Lines in a Cartesian plane or, more generally, in affine coordinates, can be described
            algebraically by linear equations. In two dimensions, the equation for non-vertical lines is
            often given in the slope-intercept form:<br />
            <b>\({\displaystyle y=mx+b}\)</b><br />
            where:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>m</b> is the slope or gradient of the line.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>b</b> is the y-intercept of the line.

        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            In three dimensions, lines can not be described by a single linear equation, so they are
            frequently described by parametric equations:<br />
            <b>\({\displaystyle x=x_{0}+at}\)</b><br />
            <b>\({\displaystyle y=y_{0}+bt}\)</b><br />

            where:<br />
        <ul>
            <li><b>x, y, and z</b> are all functions of the independent variable t which ranges over the
                real numbers.</li>
            <li><b>(x0, y0, z0)</b> is any point on the line.</li>
            <li><b>a, b, and c</b> are related to the slope of the line, such that the vector (a, b, c) is
                parallel to the line.</li>

            A plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely far.
            Planes are used in every area of geometry. For instance, planes can be studied as a topological surface
            without reference to distances or angles.<br>

            A curve is a 1-dimensional object that may be straight (like a line) or not; curves in 2-dimensional space

            A plane curve is a curve for which \({\displaystyle X}\) is the Euclidean plane—these are the examples
            first
            encountered—or
            in some cases the projective plane. A space curve is a curve for which \({\displaystyle X}\) is at least
            three-dimensional;
            a skew curve is a space curve which lies in no plane. These definitions of plane, space and skew curves
            apply also to
            real algebraic curves, although the above definition of a curve does not apply (a real algebraic curve may
            be
            disconnected).

        Surfaces
    </h2>
    <div class="theorem">
        <p>
            In mathematics, a surface is a generalization of a plane, which is not necessarily flat – that is, the
            curvature is not
            necessarily zero. This is analogous to a curve generalizing a straight line. There are many more precise
            definitions,
            depending on the context and the mathematical tools that are used to analyze the surface.

                A sphere is a surface that can be defined parametrically (by x = r sin θ cos φ, y = r sin θ sin φ, z = r
                cos θ) or
                implicitly (by x2 + y2 + z2 − r2 = 0.)

        </figure>
        <p>
            Often, a surface is defined by equations that are satisfied by the coordinates of its points. This is the
            case of the
            graph of a continuous function of two variables. The set of the zeros of a function of three variables is a
            surface,
            which is called an implicit surface. If the defining three-variate function is a polynomial, the surface is
            an
            algebraic surface. For example, the unit sphere is an algebraic surface, as it may be defined by the
            implicit equation: <br>

        Length, area, and volume
    </h2>
    <div class="theorem">
        <p>Length, area, and volume describe the size or extant of an object in one dimension, two dimension, and three
            dimensions

            calculated by the Pythagorean

            Area and volume can be defined as fundamental quantities separate from length, or they can be described and
            calculated
            in terms of lengths in a plane or 3-dimensional space.Mathematicians have found many explicit formulas for
            area and formulas for volume of various geometric objects. In
            calculus, area and volume can be defined in terms of integrals, such as the Riemann integral.
