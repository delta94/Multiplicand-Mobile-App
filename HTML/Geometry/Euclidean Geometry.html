    <p class="paragraph">
      Euclidean geometry is a mathematical system attributed to Alexandrian
      Greek mathematician <b>Euclid</b>, which he described in his textbook on
      geometry: <b>The Elements</b>. Euclid's method consists in assuming a
      small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other
      propositions (theorems) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had
      been stated by earlier mathematicians <b>Euclid</b> was the first to show
      how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and
      logical system.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
      <p class="paragraph">
        The ​Elements​ begins with plane geometry, as the first ​axiomatic
        system​ and the first examples of ​formal proof​. It goes on to the
        ​solid geometry​ of ​three dimensions​. Much of the ​Elements​ states
        results of what are now called <b>​algebra​</b> and
        <b>​number theory</b>​, explained in geometrical language.​
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Euclidean geometry is an example of ​synthetic geometry​, in that it
      proceeds logically from axioms describing basic properties of geometric
      objects such as points and lines, to propositions about those objects, all
      without the use of ​coordinates​ to specify those objects. This is in
      contrast to analytic geometry​, which uses coordinates to translate
      geometric propositions into algebraic formulas
    </p>
    <div class="summary">
      <p class="paragraph">
        Euclidean geometry is an ​axiomatic system​, in which all ​theorems​
        ("true statements") are derived from a small number of simple axioms.
        Until the advent of ​non-Euclidean geometry​, these axioms were
        considered to be obviously true in the physical world, so that all the
        theorems would be equally true.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Near the beginning of the first book of the ​Elements​, Euclid gives
        five ​postulates​ (axioms) for plane geometry:
      </p>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li>To draw a ​straight line​ from any ​point​ to any point.</li>
        <li>
          To produce (extend) a ​finite straight line​ continuously in a
          straight line.
        </li>
        <li>To describe a ​circle​ with any centre and distance (radius).</li>
        <li>That all ​right angles​ are equal to one another.</li>
        <li>
          [The ​parallel postulate​]: That, if a straight line falling on two
          straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two
          right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet
          on that side on which the angles are less than two right angles.
        </li>
      </ul>

        />
        <figcaption style="color: white;">
          If two lines intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner
          angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines
          inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far
          enough.

        The triangle angle sum theorem states that the sum of the three angles

        The Pythagorean theorem states that the sum of the areas of the two

      Congruence of triangles
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Triangles are congruent if they have all three sides equal (SSS), two
      sides and the angle between them equal (SAS), or two angles and a side
      equal (ASA) (Book I, propositions 4, 8, and 26). Triangles with three
      equal angles (AAA) are similar, but not necessarily congruent. Also,
      triangles with two equal sides and an adjacent angle are not necessarily
      equal or congruent.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHeader">
      Triangle angle sum
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      The sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to a straight angle (180
      degrees).This causes an equilateral triangle to have three interior angles
      of 60 degrees. Also, it causes every triangle to have at least two acute
      angles and up to one obtuse or right angle.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHeader">
      Pythagorean theorem
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      The celebrated Pythagorean theorem (book I, proposition 47) states that in
      any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse
      (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of
      the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a
      right angle).

      Thales' theorem

    <p class="paragraph">
      Thales' theorem, named after Thales of Miletus states that if A, B, and C
      are points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter of the circle, then
      the angle ABC is a right angle.
