      <b>Projective geometry</b> is a topic in mathematics. It is the study of
      geometric properties that are invariant with respect to projective
      transformations. This means that, compared to elementary geometry,
      <b>Projective geometry</b> has a different setting, projective space, and
      a selective set of basic geometric concepts.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Properties meaningful for projective geometry are respected by this new
      idea of transformation, which is more radical in its effects than can be
      expressed by a transformation matrix and translations.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
      <p class="paragraph">
        Projective geometry is an elementary non-metrical form of geometry,
        meaning that it is not based on a concept of distance. In two dimensions
        it begins with the study of configurations of points and lines. That
        there is indeed some geometric interest in this sparse setting was first
        established by Desargues and others in their exploration of the
        principles of perspective art.

      </figure>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Projective geometry can also be seen as a geometry of constructions with
        a straight-edge alone.Since projective geometry excludes compass
        constructions, there are no circles, no angles, no measurements, no
        parallels, and no concept of intermediacy.It was realised that the
        theorems that do apply to projective geometry are simpler statements.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Projective geometry is less restrictive than either Euclidean geometry
        or affine geometry. It is an intrinsically non-metrical geometry,
        meaning that facts are independent of any metric structure. Under the
        projective transformations, the incidence structure and the relation of
        projective harmonic conjugates are preserved.

      central principles of perspective art: that parallel lines meet at
      infinity, and therefore are drawn that way.
    </p>
    <div class="summary">
      <p class="paragraph">
        In essence, a projective geometry may be thought of as an extension of
        Euclidean geometry in which the "direction" of each line is subsumed
        within the line as an extra "point", and in which a "horizon" of
        directions corresponding to coplanar lines is regarded as a "line".
        Thus, two parallel lines meet on a horizon line by virtue of their
        incorporating the same direction.

      Axioms of projective geometry
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Any given geometry may be deduced from an appropriate set of axioms.
      Projective geometries are characterised by the "elliptic parallel" axiom,
      that any two planes always meet in just one line, or in the plane, any two
      lines always meet in just one point.
    </p>
    <h3>Whitehead's axioms</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      These axioms are based on Whitehead, "The Axioms of Projective Geometry".
      There are two types, points and lines, and one "incidence" relation
      between points and lines. The three axioms are:
    </p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li>G1: Every line contains at least 3 points</li>
      <li>G2: Every two distinct points, A and B, lie on a unique line, AB.</li>
      <li>
        G3: If lines AB and CD intersect, then so do lines AC and BD (where it
        is assumed that A and D are distinct from B and C).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Additional axioms</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      One can add further axioms restricting the dimension or the coordinate
      ring. For example, Coxeter's Projective Geometry, references Veblen in the
      three axioms above, together with a further 5 axioms that make the
      dimension 3 and the coordinate ring a commutative field of characteristic
      not 2.
    </p>
    <h3>Axioms using a ternary relation</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      One can pursue axiomatization by postulating a ternary relation, [ABC] to
      denote when three points (not all necessarily distinct) are collinear. An
      axiomatization may be written down in terms of this relation as well:
    </p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li>C0: [ABA]</li>
      <li>
        C1: If A and B are two points such that [ABC] and [ABD] then [BDC]
      </li>
      <li>
        C2: If A and B are two points then there is a third point C such that
        [ABC]
      </li>
      <li>
        C3: If A and C are two points, B and D also, with [BCE], [ADE] but not
        [ABE] then there is a point F such that [ACF] and [BDF].
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Axioms for projective planes</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      In incidence geometry, most authors give a treatment that embraces the
      Fano plane \(PG(2, 2)\) as the smallest finite projective plane. An axiom
      system that achieves this is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li>(P1) Any two distinct points lie on a unique line.</li>
      <li>(P2) Any two distinct lines meet in a unique point.</li>
      <li>
        (P3) There exist at least four points of which no three are collinear
      </li>
    </ul>
