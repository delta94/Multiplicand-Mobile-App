      <b>Number theory</b> has interested and motivated mathematicians for
      centuries. It is a branch of mathematics that deals with topics such as
      even and odd numbers, prime and composite numbers, divisibility, greatest
      common factor (GCF) and least common multiple (LCM), and terminating and
      repeating decimals. These topics lay the foundation for the development of
      fraction concepts.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Two very useful concepts to understand when working with fractions are the
      greatest common factor (GCF) and the least common multiple (LCM). The GCF
      for two or more numbers is the greatest number that divides evenly into
      those numbers. For example, the GCF for 72 and 54 is 18, since 18 is the
      greatest number that divides evenly into both numbers without a remainder.
      There are several ways to find the GCF of two numbers.

        Thus, the GCF of 54 and 72 is 2 x 3 x 3, or 18. Another way to find the
        GCF for two numbers is to divide both numbers by their common factors
        successively until there are no more common factors. The product of all
        the common factors you divided by is the GCF. See the example below.

    <p class="paragraph">
      Since 3 and 4 have no common factor other than 1, the GCF for 72 and 54 is
      2 x 3 x 3, or 18. One of the most common uses for the GCF is in the
      simplification of fractions by dividing the numerator and denominator by
      their GCF. Let's look at the fraction \(\frac{54}{72}\) We found the GCF
      to be 18. Dividing both the numerator 54 and the denominator 72 by 18
      gives us \(\frac{54\div 18}{72\div 18 }\) , or \(\frac{3}{4}\) when
      simplified.

    <p class="paragraph">
      The LCM of two or more numbers is the least nonzero number that those
      numbers will divide. For example, the LCM of 18 and 24 is 72, since that
      is the least nonzero number into which 18 and 24 will divide evenly. There
      are several ways to find the LCM of two or more numbers. One way is to
      write the prime factorizations of the numbers and multiply the greatest
      powers of the prime numbers that appear in any of the numbers. Let's begin
      finding the LCM for 18 and 24, by writing the prime factorizations of the
      two numbers.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      18 = 2 x 3² and 24 = 3 x 2³ The greatest power of 2 that appears is 2³ and
      the greatest power of 3 is 3². Thus the LCM of 18 and 24 is 2³ x 3², or
      72.
    </p>
    <div class="summary">
      <p class="paragraph">
        Another way to find the LCM is to list the multiples of each number
        until you find the first multiple that appears in each list. Applying
        this method to find the LCM of 18 and 24, we see that the multiples of
        18 are 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, and so on, and the multiples of 24 are 24,
        48, 72, 96, and so on, so the LCM of 18 and 24 is 72. One of the primary
        uses for the LCM is in adding and subtracting fractions with unlike
        denominators. One way to add or subtract those fractions is to find the
        least common denominator (LCD), which is the LCM of the denominators.
