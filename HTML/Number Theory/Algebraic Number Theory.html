  <p class="paragraph">
    Algebraic number theory is the study of roots of polynomials with rational or integral
    coefficients. These numbers lie in algebraic structures with many similar properties to those
    of the integers. The historical motivation for the creation of the subject was solving certain
    Diophantine equations, most notably Fermat's famous conjecture, which was eventually proved by
    Wiles et al. in the 1990s:
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    If n is a positive integer \( \geq 3\), and \( x^{n}+y^{n} = z^{^n}\) for integers x,y,z ,
    then xyz = 0.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    The main idea is that an expression like \( z^{n} - y^{n}\) will not factor completely over
    the rational numbers, but will factor into linear factors if the coefficients are allowed to
    include the primitive \(n^{th}\) root of unity \(\zeta _{n}\).
  </p>
  <h2 class="subHeader">Algebraic Numbers and Algebraic Integers</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">
    A complex number \(\alpha \) is an algebraic number if it is a root of a monic polynomial with
    rational coefficients. It is an algebraic integer if is a root of a monic polynomial with
    integer coefficients.
  </p>
  <div class="note">
    <ul class="note-list">
      <li class="notes">
        \(\sqrt{2}\) is an algebraic integer, as it is a root of the polynomial \(f(x) = x^{2} -
        2\).
      </li>
      <li class="notes">
        \(3\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}\) is an algebraic number, as it is a root of the polynomial \(f(x) =
        x^{3} - \frac{1}{2}\). It is not an algebraic integer, although this is not immediately
        obvious.

      <li class="notes">
        The primitive \(n^{th}\) root of unity \(\zeta _{n} = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{n}} =

  <p class="paragraph">
    Algebraic number theory deals with the algebraic aspects of these numbers, forgetting that
    they are real or complex numbers (or more precisely forgetting where they are located amongst
    other real or complex numbers). What matters is the algebraic relations that these numbers
    satisfy.

    Minimal Polynomial
  </h2>
  <p class="paragraph">
    Any algebraic number (or algebraic integer) \(\alpha \) is a root of many polynomials with
    rational (or integral) coefficients; for instance, \sqrt{2} is also a root of \(x^{4} -
    5x^{2}+6\). But there is one polynomial that is, in a sense, the polynomial of which \(\alpha
    \) is a root. <br />
    <b>The minimal polynomial of an algebraic number \(\alpha \) is the monic polynomial with
      rational coefficients of minimal degree of which \(\alpha \) is a root.</b>
  </p>
  <div class="theorem">
    <p>
      Let \(\alpha \) be an algebraic number and let \(f(x)\) be its minimal polynomial. Then the
      following are true:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>If \(g(a) = 0\) and \(g(x)\) has rational coefficients, then \(f(x) \mid g(x)\)</li>
      <li>
        \(f(x)\) is irreducible, i.e. it cannot be factored as the product of two polynomials with
        rational coefficients of smaller degree: \(f(x) = a(x)b(x)\) with \(deg(a)\), \(deg(b)\) < \(deg(f)\). </li>
      <li>
        If \(g(\alpha) = 0, g(x)\) is monic with rational coefficients, and \(g(x)\) is
        irreducible, then \(g(x) = f(x)\).
      </li>
      <li>
        \(f\) has integer coefficients if and only if \(\alpha \) is an algebraic integer.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <h2 class="subHeader">Unique Factorization</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">
    A nice property of \(\mathbb Z\) is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that every integer
    factors essentially uniquely as the product of primes. It would be quite useful if this
    property extended to rings like \(\mathbb{Z}\begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{d} \end{bmatrix}\)
  </p>
  <h2 class="subHeader">
    Rings and Ideals in Algebraic Number Theory
  </h2>
  <p class="paragraph">
    The sets \(\mathbb Z \begin{bmatrix} \alpha \end{bmatrix} \) considered above are special
    cases of a general algebraic object called a ring. A ring is a set equipped with two
    operations, addition and multiplication, satisfying various natural properties (commutativity,
    distributivity, etc.). Rings with division algorithms are called Euclidean rings. As discussed
    above, Euclidean rings have some form of unique factorization into irreducibles.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    It turns out that unique factorization can be recovered in some weaker sense for the rings
    \(\mathbb Z \begin{bmatrix} \alpha \end{bmatrix} \) which are not Euclidean, by passing to
    ideals. These were introduced in the \(19^{th}\) th century by Ernst Kummer, a number theorist
    who worked on Fermat's conjecture.
  </p>
  <div class="theorem">
    <p>
      An ideal \(\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots,\beta_k\) in \(R = \mathbb{Z}\begin{bmatrix} \alpha
      \end{bmatrix}\) is the set <br />
      <b>
        { \({\beta _{1}r_{1} + .... + \beta _{k}r_{k} : r_{i}\in R}\) }
      </b>
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The ideal is said to be generated by \(\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots,\beta_k\) <br />
      Note that an ideal is closed under addition and "swallows up" under multiplication: if
      \(\alpha \in I\) and \(r \in R\). (These two properties are used for a more general
      definition of an ideal for a general ring, but this down-to-earth definition is equivalent
      to the general one for the rings considered here.)
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2 class="subHeader">Major Results</h2>
  <h3 class="result">1. Finiteness of the class group</h3>
  <p class="paragraph">
    One of the classical results in algebraic number theory is that the ideal class group of an
    algebraic number field K is finite. This is a consequence of Minkowski's theorem since there
    are only finitely many Integral ideals with norm less than a fixed positive integer. The order
    of the class group is called the class number, and is often denoted by the letter h.
  </p>
  <h3 class="result">2. Dirichlet's unit theorem</h3>
  <p class="paragraph">
    Dirichlet's unit theorem provides a description of the structure of the multiplicative group
    of units \(O^{x}\) of the ring of integers \(O\). Specifically, it states that \(O^{x}\) is
    isomorphic to \(G\times Z^{r}\), where G is the finite cyclic group consisting of all the
    roots of unity in \(O\), and \( r = r_{1} + r_{2} - 1\). In other words, \(O^{x}\) is a
    finitely generated abelian group of rank \( r = r_{1} + r_{2} - 1\) whose torsion consists of
    the roots of unity in O.

  <h3 class="result">
    Reciprocity laws
  </h3>
  <p class="paragraph">
    In terms of the Legendre symbol, the law of quadratic reciprocity for positive odd primes
    states <br />
    <br />
    \(\left({\frac {p}{q}}\right)\left({\frac {q}{p}}\right)=(-1)^{{\frac {p-1}{2}}{\frac
    {q-1}{2}}}.\)
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    A reciprocity law is a generalization of the law of quadratic reciprocity. There are several
    different ways to express reciprocity laws. The early reciprocity laws found in the 19th
    century were usually expressed in terms of a power residue symbol (p/q) generalizing the
    quadratic reciprocity symbol, that describes when a prime number is an nth power residue
    modulo another prime, and gave a relation between (p/q) and (q/p). Hilbert reformulated the
    reciprocity laws as saying that a product over p of Hilbert symbols (a,b/p), taking values in
    roots of unity, is equal to 1. Artin's reformulated reciprocity law states that the Artin
    symbol from ideals (or ideles) to elements of a Galois group is trivial on a certain subgroup.
    Several more recent generalizations express reciprocity laws using cohomology of groups or
    representations of adelic groups or algebraic K-groups, and their relationship with the
    original quadratic reciprocity law can be hard to see.

    Class number formula
  </h3>
  <p class="paragraph">
    The class number formula relates many important invariants of a number field to a special
    value of its Dedekind zeta function.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    \( \zeta_{K}(s)\) converges absolutely for \(Re(s) > 1\) 1 and extends to a meromorphic
    function defined for all complex s with only one simple pole at \(s=1\) with residue:
    <br /><br />
    <b>\({\displaystyle \lim _{s\to 1}(s-1)\zeta _{K}(s)={\frac {2^{r_{1}}\cdot (2\pi
      )^{r_{2}}\cdot \operatorname {Reg} _{K}\cdot h_{K}}{w_{K}\cdot {\sqrt {|D_{K}|}}}}}\)</b>
