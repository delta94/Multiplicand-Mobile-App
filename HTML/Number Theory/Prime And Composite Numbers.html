      A <b>prime number</b> (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that
      is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater
      than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is
      prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1,
      involve 5 itself. However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 × 2)
      in which both numbers are smaller than 4. Primes are central in number
      theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural
      number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a
      product of primes that is unique up to their order.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      The property of being prime is called <b>primality</b>. A simple but slow
      method of checking the primality of a given number n, called trial
      division, tests whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and
      \(\sqrt{n}\). Faster algorithms include the
      <b>Miller–Rabin primality test</b>, which is fast but has a small chance
      of error, and the AKS primality test, which always produces the correct
      answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical. Particularly
      fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as Mersenne
      numbers. As of December 2018 the largest known prime number has 24,862,048
      decimal digits.

          There are infinitely many primes, as demonstrated by Euclid around 300
          BC. No known simple formula separates prime numbers from composite
          numbers. However, the distribution of primes within the natural
          numbers in the large can be statistically modelled. The first result
          in that direction is the prime number theorem, proven at the end of
          the 19th century, which says that the probability of a randomly chosen
          number being prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits,
          that is, to its logarithm.
        </li>
        <li>
          Several historical questions regarding prime numbers are still
          unsolved. These include Goldbach's conjecture, that every even integer
          greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, and the twin
          prime conjecture, that there are infinitely many pairs of primes
          having just one even number between them. Such questions spurred the
          development of various branches of number theory, focusing on analytic
          or algebraic aspects of numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Primes are used in several routines in information technology, such as
          public-key cryptography, which relies on the difficulty of factoring
          large numbers into their prime factors. In abstract algebra, objects
          that behave in a generalized way like prime numbers include prime
          elements and prime ideals.

      Definition and Examples
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      A natural number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) is called a prime number (or a
      prime) if it is greater than 1 and cannot be written as the product of two
      smaller natural numbers. The numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are
      called composite numbers. In other words, n is prime if n items cannot be
      divided up into smaller equal-size groups of more than one item, or if it
      is not possible to arrange n dots into a rectangular grid that is more
      than one dot wide and more than one dot high.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      For example, among the numbers 1 through 6, the numbers 2, 3, and 5 are
      the prime numbers, as there are no other numbers that divide them evenly
      (without a remainder). 1 is not prime, as it is specifically excluded in
      the definition. 4 = 2 × 2 and 6 = 2 × 3 are both composite.

        The divisors of a natural number n are the natural numbers that divide n
        evenly. Every natural number has both 1 and itself as a divisor. If it
        has any other divisor, it cannot be prime. This idea leads to a
        different but equivalent definition of the primes: they are the numbers
        with exactly two positive divisors, 1 and the number itself. Yet another
        way to express the same thing is that a number n is prime if it is
        greater than one and if none of the numbers 2,3,…,n−1 divides n evenly.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The first 25 prime numbers (all the prime numbers less than 100) are: 2,
        3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71,
        73, 79, 83, 89, 97 (sequence A000040 in the OEIS). No even number n
        greater than 2 is prime because any such number can be expressed as the
        product 2×n/2. Therefore, every prime number other than 2 is an odd
        number, and is called an odd prime. Similarly, when written in the usual
        decimal system, all prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1, 3, 7, or 9.
        The numbers that end with other digits are all composite: decimal
        numbers that end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 are even, and decimal numbers that
        end in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5.

    <p class="paragraph">
      A <b>composite number</b> is a positive integer that can be formed by
      multiplying two smaller positive integers. Equivalently, it is a positive
      integer that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself.Every
      positive integer is composite, prime, or the unit 1, so the composite
      numbers are exactly the numbers that are not prime and not a unit.

      Every composite number can be written as the product of two or more (not
      necessarily distinct) primes.For example, the composite number 299 can be
      written as 13 × 23, and the composite number 360 can be written as 23 × 32
      × 5; furthermore, this representation is unique up to the order of the
      factors. This fact is called the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. There
      are several known primality tests that can determine whether a number is
      prime or composite, without necessarily revealing the factorization of a
      composite input.
    </div>
    <h2 class="subHeader">Types</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      One way to classify composite numbers is by counting the number of prime
      factors. A composite number with two prime factors is a semiprime or
      2-almost prime (the factors need not be distinct, hence squares of primes
      are included). A composite number with three distinct prime factors is a
      sphenic number. In some applications, it is necessary to differentiate
      between composite numbers with an odd number of distinct prime factors and
      those with an even number of distinct prime factors. For the latter
      \(\varphi(n) = -1^{2x}=1\)
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      (where \(\varphi\) is the Möbius function and x is half the total of prime
      factors), while for the former
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      \(\varphi(n) = -1^{2x+1}=-1\)
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      However, for prime numbers, the function also returns −1 and \(\varphi(n)
      = 1\). For a number n with one or more repeated prime factors, and
      \(\varphi(n) = 0\).<br />
      If all the prime factors of a number are repeated it is called a powerful
      number (All perfect powers are powerful numbers). If none of its prime
      factors are repeated, it is called squarefree. (All prime numbers and 1
      are squarefree.)

      <p class="paragraph">
        Another way to classify composite numbers is by counting the number of
        divisors. All composite numbers have at least three divisors. In the
        case of squares of primes, those divisors are (\(1, p, p^{2}\)). A
        number n that has more divisors than any x < n is a highly composite
        number (though the first two such numbers are 1 and 2).<br /><br />
        <b>Composite numbers</b> have also been called "rectangular numbers" ,
        but that name can also refer to the pronic numbers, numbers that are the
        product of two consecutive integers. Yet another way to classify
        composite numbers is to determine whether all prime factors are either
        all below or all above some fixed (prime) number. Such numbers are
        called smooth numbers and rough numbers, respectively.
