    Number theory is the branch of mathematics that studies integers, which are all the whole
    numbers on either side of the number line. Number theory looks at specific properties of
    integers and seeks patterns in the ways different types of numbers are distributed or related
    to each other.

    Integers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations (Diophantine
    geometry). Questions in number theory are often best understood through the study of
    analytical objects (for example, the Riemann zeta function) that encode properties of the
    integers, primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion (analytic number theory).
    One may also study real numbers in relation to rational numbers, for example, as approximated
    by the latter (Diophantine approximation).
  </p>
  <h2 class="subHeader">
    Analytic number theory
  </h2>
  <p class="paragraph">
    Analytic number theory may be defined as the study of the integers by means of tools from real
    and complex analysis.In terms of its concerns, as the study within number theory of estimates
    on size and density, as opposed to identities.
  </p>
  <div class="theorem">
    <p class="paragraph">
      Some of the examples of problems in analytic number theory: the prime number theorem, the
      Goldbach conjecture (or the twin prime conjecture, or the Hardyâ€“Littlewood conjectures), the
      Waring problem and the Riemann hypothesis. Some of the most important tools of analytic
      number theory are the circle method, sieve methods and L-functions (or, rather, the study of
      their properties).
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2 class="subHeader">
    Diophantine geometry
  </h2>
  <p class="paragraph">
    The central problem of Diophantine geometry is to determine when a Diophantine equation has
    solutions, and if it does, how many. The approach taken is to think of the solutions of an
    equation as a geometric object.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    An equation in two variables defines a curve in the plane. More generally, an equation, or
    system of equations, in two or more variables defines a curve, a surface or some other such
    object in n-dimensional space. In Diophantine geometry, one asks whether there are any
    rational points (points all of whose coordinates are rationals) or integral points (points all
    of whose coordinates are integers) on the curve or surface. If there are any such points, the
    next step is to ask how many there are and how they are distributed. A basic question in this
    direction is if there are finitely or infinitely many rational points on a given curve (or
    surface).

      Two examples of an elliptic curve, that is, a curve of genus 1 having at least one rational
      point. (Either graph can be seen as a slice of a torus in four-dimensional space.)
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <div class="theorem">
    <p class="paragraph">
      In the Pythagorean equation \({\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=1,}\) we would like to study its
      rational solutions, that is, its solutions \((x,y)\) such that x and y are both rational.
      This is the same as asking for all integer solutions to \(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2} \); any solution
      to the latter equation gives us a solution \(x = a/c, y=b/c\) to the former. It is also the
      same as asking for all points with rational coordinates on the curve described by \(x^2 +
      y^2 = 1\). (This curve happens to be a circle of radius 1 around the origin.)
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2 class="subHeader">
    Probabilistic number theory
  </h2>
  <p class="paragraph">
    Much of probabilistic number theory can be seen as an important special case of the study of
    variables that are almost, but not quite, mutually independent. For example, the event that a
    random integer between one and a million be divisible by two and the event that it be
    divisible by three are almost independent, but not quite.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    It is sometimes said that probabilistic combinatorics uses the fact that whatever happens with
    probability greater than {\displaystyle 0}{\displaystyle 0} must happen sometimes; one may say
    with equal justice that many applications of probabilistic number theory hinge on the fact
    that whatever is unusual must be rare. If certain algebraic objects (say, rational or integer
    solutions to certain equations) can be shown to be in the tail of certain sensibly defined
    distributions, it follows that there must be few of them; this is a very concrete
    non-probabilistic statement following from a probabilistic one.
  </p>
  <h2 class="subHeader">
    Arithmetic combinatorics
  </h2>
  <p class="paragraph">
    If we begin from a fairly "thick" infinite set \(A\), does it contain many elements in
    arithmetic progression: \(a\), \({\displaystyle a+b,a+2b,a+3b,\ldots ,a+10b}\), say? Should it
    be possible to write large integers as sums of elements of \(A\).
  </p>
  <div class="theorem">
    <p class="paragraph">
      These questions are characteristic of arithmetic combinatorics. This is a presently
      coalescing field; it subsumes additive number theory (which concerns itself with certain
      very specific sets \(A\) of arithmetic significance, such as the primes or the squares) and,
      arguably, some of the geometry of numbers, together with some rapidly developing new
      material. Its focus on issues of growth and distribution accounts in part for its developing
      links with ergodic theory, finite group theory, model theory, and other fields. The term
      additive combinatorics is also used; however, the sets \(A\) being studied need not be sets
      of integers, but rather subsets of non-commutative groups, for which the multiplication
      symbol, not the addition symbol, is traditionally used; they can also be subsets of rings,
      in which case the growth of \(A+A\) and \(A.A\) may be compared.
