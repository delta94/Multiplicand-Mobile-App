      An <b>exponential function</b> with base b is defined by f (x) = abx where
      a ≠0, b > 0 , b ≠1, and x is any real number. The base, b, is constant and
      the exponent, x, is a variable.

      <b>Exponential functions</b> grow by common factors over equal intervals.
      As such, <b>exponential functions</b> are used to model a wide range of
      real-life situations (such as populations, bacteria, radioactive
      substances, temperatures, bank accounts, credit payments, compound
      interest, electricity, medicine, tournaments, etc.).

      Any quantity that grows (or decays) by a fixed percent at regular
      intervals is said to possess exponential growth or exponential decay.

        In exponential growth, the quantity increases, slowly at first, and then
        very rapidly. The rate of change increases over time. The rate of growth
        becomes faster as time passes. This rapid growth is what is meant by the
        expression "increases exponentially".

      Translations of Exponential Graphs
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      A <b>horizontal translation</b> may affect the increasing / decreasing (if
      multiplied by a negative), the left hand / right hand behavior of the
      graph, and the y-intercept, but it won't change the location of the
      horizontal asymptote.<br /><br />
      A <b>vertical translation</b> may affect the increasing / decreasing (if
      multiplied by a negative), the y-intercept, and the location of the
      horizontal asymptote. It will not change whether the graph goes without
      bound or is asymptotic (although it may change where it is asymptotic) to
      the left or right.

      As x increases without bound, the quantity \((1 + \frac{1}{x})^{x}\) will
      approach the transcendental number \(e\). <br />

        The limit notation shown is from calculus. The limit notation is a way
        of asking what happens to the expression as x approaches the value
        shown. The limit is the dividing line between calculus and algebra.
        Calculus is algebra with the concept of limit. People always have this
        dread of calculus that I can't understand. The calculus itself is easy.
        The reason people don't do well in calculus is not because of the
        calculus, but because of they are poor at algebra.
