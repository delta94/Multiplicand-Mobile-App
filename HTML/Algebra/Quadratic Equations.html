      A <b>Quadratic</b> is a polynomial whose highest exponent is 2. \(ax^{2} +
      bx + c\). The coefficient of \(x^{2}\) is called the leading coeffieient.
      where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers,
      where a ≠ 0.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      If a = 0, then the equation is linear, not quadratic, as there is no
      \(ax^{2}\) term. The numbers a, b, and c are the coefficients of the
      equation and may be distinguished by calling them, respectively, the
      quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant or free
      term.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
      <p class="paragraph">
        The values of x that satisfy the equation are called solutions of the
        equation, and roots or zeros of the expression on its left-hand side. A
        quadratic equation has at most two solutions. If there is no real
        solution, there are two complex solutions. If there is only one
        solution, one says that it is a double root. A quadratic equation always
        has two roots, if complex roots are included and a double root is
        counted for two. A quadratic equation can be factored into an equivalent
        equation <br />
        \({\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=a(x-r)(x-s)=0}\)

      Solving the quadratic equation
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      A quadratic equation with real or complex coefficients has two solutions,
      called roots. These two solutions may or may not be distinct, and they may
      or may not be real.
    </p>
    <h3>1. Factoring by Inspection</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      t may be possible to express a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 as a
      product (px + q)(rx + s) = 0. In some cases, it is possible, by simple
      inspection, to determine values of p, q, r, and s that make the two forms
      equivalent to one another. If the quadratic equation is written in the
      second form, then the "Zero Factor Property" states that the quadratic
      equation is satisfied if px + q = 0 or rx + s = 0. Solving these two
      linear equations provides the roots of the quadratic.
    </p>
    <div class="summary">
      If one is given a quadratic equation in the form x2 + bx + c = 0, the
      sought factorization has the form (x + q)(x + s), and one has to find two
      numbers q and s that add up to b and whose product is c (this is sometimes
      called <b>Vieta's rule</b> and is related to Vieta's formulas).

        For the quadratic function y = x2 − x − 2, the points where the graph
        crosses the x-axis, x = −1 and x = 2, are the solutions of the quadratic
        equation x2 − x − 2 = 0.

    <h3>2. Completing the Square</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      The process of completing the square makes use of the algebraic identity
      \(x^{2}+2hx+h^{2}=(x+h)^{2},\) <br />
      which represents a well-defined algorithm that can be used to solve any
      quadratic equation. Starting with a quadratic equation in standard form,
      ax2 + bx + c = 0
    </p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li>
        Divide each side by a, the coefficient of the squared term.
      </li>
      <li>Subtract the constant term c/a from both sides.</li>
      <li>
        Add the square of one-half of b/a, the coefficient of x, to both sides.
        This "completes the square", converting the left side into a perfect
        square.
      </li>
      <li>
        Write the left side as a square and simplify the right side if
        necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Produce two linear equations by equating the square root of the left
        side with the positive and negative square roots of the right side.
      </li>
      <li>Solve each of the two linear equations.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Quadratic formula</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Completing the square can be used to derive a general formula for solving
      quadratic equations, called the quadratic formula.t can easily be seen, by
      polynomial expansion, that the following equation is equivalent to the
      quadratic equation: <br /><br />
      \(\left(x+{\frac {b}{2a}}\right)^{2}={\frac {b^{2}-4ac}{4a^{2}}}.\)
      <br /><br />
      Taking the square root of both sides, and isolating x, gives: <br /><br />
      \({\displaystyle x={\frac {-b\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}.}\)
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHeader">Applications</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      The golden ratio is found as the positive solution of the quadratic
      equation \(x^{2}-x-1=0.\) The equations of the circle and the other conic
      sections—ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas—are quadratic equations in
      two variables.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Given the cosine or sine of an angle, finding the cosine or sine of the
      angle that is half as large involves solving a quadratic equation.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      The process of simplifying expressions involving the square root of an
      expression involving the square root of another expression involves
      finding the two solutions of a quadratic equation.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
      <p class="paragraph">
        The equation given by Fuss' theorem, giving the relation among the
        radius of a bicentric quadrilateral's inscribed circle, the radius of
        its circumscribed circle, and the distance between the centers of those
        circles, can be expressed as a quadratic equation for which the distance
        between the two circles' centers in terms of their radii is one of the
        solutions. The other solution of the same equation in terms of the
        relevant radii gives the distance between the circumscribed circle's
        center and the center of the excircle of an ex-tangential quadrilateral.
