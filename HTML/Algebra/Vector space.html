      A <b>vector space</b> (also called a <b>linear space</b>) is a collection
      of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied
      ("scaled") by numbers, called scalars. Scalars are often taken to be real
      numbers, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by
      complex numbers, rational numbers, or generally any field.

        a vector v (blue) is added to another vector w (red, upper
        illustration). Below, w is stretched by a factor of 2, yielding the sum
        v + 2w.

        The first example of a vector space consists of arrows in a fixed plane,
        starting at one fixed point. This is used in physics to describe forces
        or velocities. Given any two such arrows, v and w, the parallelogram
        spanned by these two arrows contains one diagonal arrow that starts at
        the origin, too. This new arrow is called the sum of the two arrows and
        is denoted v + w. In the special case of two arrows on the same line,
        their sum is the arrow on this line whose length is the sum or the
        difference of the lengths, depending on whether the arrows have the same
        direction. Another operation that can be done with arrows is scaling:
        given any positive real number a, the arrow that has the same direction
        as v, but is dilated or shrunk by multiplying its length by a, is called
        multiplication of v by a. It is denoted av. When a is negative, av is
        defined as the arrow pointing in the opposite direction, instead.

      A vector space over a field \(F\) is a set \(V\) together with two
      operations that satisfy the eight axioms listed below. In the following,
      \(V × V\)denotes the Cartesian product of V with itself, and \(→\) denotes
      a mapping from one set to another.
    </p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li>
        The first operation, called <b>vector addition</b> or simply addition
        \(+\) : \(V × V → V,\) takes any two vectors v and w and assigns to them
        a third vector which is commonly written as v + w, and called the sum of
        these two vectors. (The resultant vector is also an element of the set
        \(V\))
      </li>
      <li>
        The second operation, called <b>scalar multiplication</b> : \(F × V →
        V，\) takes any scalar a and any vector v and gives another vector av.
        (Similarly, the vector av is an element of the set \(V\). Scalar
        multiplication is not to be confused with the scalar product, also
        called inner product or dot product, which is an additional structure
        present on some specific, but not all vector spaces. Scalar
        multiplication is a multiplication of a vector by a scalar; the other is
        a multiplication of two vectors producing a scalar.)

    <p class="paragraph">
      Elements of \(V\) are commonly called vectors. Elements of \(F\) are
      commonly called scalars.
